# Archive - Legacy Competing Risks Files

## üìÅ Archived Files

This directory contains earlier versions and experimental code that were part of the competing risks analysis development process.

### Files Overview

| File | Original Purpose | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|
| `survey_weight_demo.R` | IPTW and survey weights demonstration | Archived - Educational supplement |
| `legacy_competing_comp.R` | Original competing risks comparison | Archived - Superseded by educational version |
| `legacy_package_comp.R` | Package-focused comparison study | Archived - Functionality integrated |
| `legacy_se_comparison.R` | Standard error comparison analysis | Archived - Replaced by comprehensive version |
| `legacy_se_estimate.R` | SE estimation methodology | Archived - Included in main analysis |

### Why Archived?

These files were moved to maintain a clean project structure while preserving development history. They contain:

- **Overlapping functionality** now consolidated in `educational_cr_analysis.R`
- **Experimental approaches** that informed the final implementation
- **Alternative methodologies** that may be useful for reference
- **Development iterations** showing the evolution of the analysis

### Usage

These files are preserved for:
- **Historical reference** of development process
- **Alternative implementations** for comparison
- **Code reuse** for specific components if needed
- **Learning purposes** to see different approaches

### Note

All functionality from these legacy files has been improved and integrated into the main educational analysis. Use the main `educational_cr_analysis.R` for current work.
